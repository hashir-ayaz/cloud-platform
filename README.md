  - User registration with email verification.
  - Secure login with password hashing and reset functionality.
  - JWT-based session management.
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Team Owner, Developer).
  - Team management with invitations and permissions.

- **API Key Management**:
  - Unique API keys per container with usage tracking.
  - API key generation, revocation, and rotation.
  - Customizable API key permission scopes and expiration.

---

### 2. **Container Management**

- **Deployment Features**:

  - Deploy containers from predefined images.
  - Configure environment variables, port management, and health checks.
  - Access container logs and manage container restarts.
  - Resource allocation for CPU, memory, and storage.

- **Networking**:
  - Automatic DNS provisioning and SSL/TLS certificate management.
  - Support for custom domain mapping and load balancing.
  - Path-based routing and HTTP/HTTPS endpoint configuration.

---

### 3. **Rate Limiting System**

- **Request Limiting**:

  - Set request limits per container with configurable time windows.
  - Monitor rate limits and receive alerts for breaches.

- **Resource Limiting**:
  - Enforce CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth limits.
  - Configure concurrent connection restrictions.

---

### 4. **Monitoring & Analytics**

- **System Metrics**:

  - Monitor resource usage, response times, and error rates.
  - Analyze traffic, uptime, and performance metrics.

- **Logging**:
  - Centralized log management with filtering and retention policies.
  - Real-time log streaming and audit logging.

---

### 5. **Security Features**

- Enforce HTTPS and network isolation.
- Implement IP whitelisting, security headers, and DDoS protection.
- Role-based access control, request signing, and CORS configuration.
- Regular vulnerability scanning and updates.

---

### 6. **User Interface**

- **Dashboard**:

  - Manage containers, view logs, and visualize resource usage.
  - API key and team management, billing information, and system status.

- **Documentation**:
  - API guides, SDKs, and troubleshooting resources.

---

### 7. **Billing & Usage**

- Usage-based billing with resource pricing and cost estimation.
- Invoice generation and usage alerts.
- Bandwidth and storage tracking.

---

### 8. **Developer Tools**

- API testing interface with Postman collection export and OpenAPI specs.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines, Git webhooks, and CLI tools.
- Client SDK generation and deployment automation.

---

### 9. **System Administration**

- System health monitoring, resource allocation, and user management.
- Backup management, system updates, and maintenance scheduling.
- Support system with ticketing, knowledge base, and alert management.

---

### 10. **Performance Requirements**

- Request latency < 100ms.
- 99.9% uptime with global CDN integration and load balancing.
- Automatic scaling and cache management.

---

## Future Considerations

- Multi-region deployment and Kubernetes integration.
- Support for serverless functions and AI/ML model deployment.
- Database as a service and message queue integration.

---

## Compliance & Standards

- GDPR compliance and data privacy controls.
- Industry-standard certifications and security policies.

---

## Disaster Recovery

- Automated backups, data replication, and failover systems.
- Incident response and business continuity planning.
